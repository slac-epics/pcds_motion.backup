README for various PCDS MCode Implementations
Last Updated: 2013-10-09 by klg

This is intended to give a quick overview of which MCode version is used 
for which motors.

V2 - PCDS Generic MCode
Used for any motor that is serviced by the pcds_motion module.

V3 - Pulse Picker MCode
Used only for pulse picker spindle motors. Read out variable Ns to see 
the revision number for this particular variant.

V4 - PCDS Generic MCode w/o PU Flag
Used for timing phase shifter "motors" to avoid the need to clear the PU 
flag on power-cycle (it is critical that these come up in automated 
fashion). That is the only difference between this and V2.
